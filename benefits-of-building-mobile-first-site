When building a mobile application, a developer will have to choose a digital platform to focus on first, since different code is required for the same app to exist across various mobile devices.  Building a “mobile-first” or a responsive web design site allows the product to be easy to read, use and navigate on all devices.  A “mobile-first” site is able to resize and shift text and images depending on the screen size of the device.  This is a huge benefit because all potential customers and/or users are able to access the product, regardless of which device they are using.  In doing some research, I found that 
[Webflow] (https://webflow.com/) 
is a service that allows one to build a responsive style website without code, simply through a visual editor style.
