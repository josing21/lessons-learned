Designing a technical tool such as a website or app, requires that many different types of individuals collaborate: front-end developers, back-end developers, project managers, etc. Project and process management tools help individuals working on different aspects of a single project understand what each person or team is working on, how long it will take to complete, and what are the required next steps. Some of the tools we tested and discussed in class include: Leankit, Jira and Trello. Below is a brief description of each tool’s features, along with a summary of our classmates’ feedback:
Leankit: Leankit allows team members to split their projects into different work streams such as “technical” or “non-technical”, and then track different phases on of the project through different “stage gates”. Our classmates enjoyed the tool’s simple interface, and also liked that the tool appeared to have a great deal of functionality, but it did not get in the way of completing simple tasks. On the other hand, our classmates struggled to find a way to work off of the same template.

Jira: Jira also allows team members to track a project’s different work-streams. Unlike Leankit, our classmates found Jira’s interface to be complicate and confusing. The tool has significant functionality, but our classmates found it difficult to weed through all the different features in order to create a simple template.

Trello: Trello is another tool that allows project team members to track the progress of one another’s work. Our classmates liked Trello’s simple interface—it was easy to set up and invite other users to use a specific template. On the other hand, our classmates could see that Trello had limited functionality, and that they might have to use an additional tool to track more complex projects.
